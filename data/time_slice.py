# data/time_slice.py
"""Point-in-time slicing of financial data to prevent look-ahead bias.

When replaying the analysis pipeline for a historical date, we must ensure
that only financial data that *would have been publicly available* on that
date is used.  A fiscal year ending 2024-12-31 is typically not filed until
60-90 days later (10-K deadline), so the default reporting lag is 90 days.
